   - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/internet_gateway

5. **Route Table for Public Subnet**
   - Define a route table and associate it with the public subnet.

6. **Route Table Association**
   - Associate the route table with the public subnet.
   - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route_table
   - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route_table_association

   - Allocate an Elastic IP and associate it with the web server instance.

9. **Create Instance for DB Server**
   - Launch a database server instance within the private subnet.

10. **Create NAT Gateway**
    - Set up a NAT Gateway for the private subnet to access the internet.
